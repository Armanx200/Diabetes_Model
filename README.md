# Diabetes Prediction Model ðŸ©ºðŸ“Š

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Model repository! This project is aimed at predicting diabetes using logistic regression on a dataset. Below you'll find details on how to use the model, its performance, and how to get started.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project involves building a logistic regression model to predict diabetes based on various features. The dataset used includes information on demographics, health conditions, and lifestyle factors.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Armanx200/Diabetes_Model.git
   cd Diabetes_Model
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python 3.12 or later. Install the required packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Model**
   Execute the following script to run the model:
   ```bash
   python Model.py
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Model Performance

The logistic regression model's performance is summarized below:

- **Accuracy**: 96.07%
- **Confusion Matrix**:
  ```
  [[18140   157]
   [  629  1074]]
  ```
- **Classification Report**:
